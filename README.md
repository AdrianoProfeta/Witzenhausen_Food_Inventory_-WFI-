Witzenhausen_Food_Inventory_WFI

Sustainable food consumption is an important issue in the analysis and research of consumer behaviour. Nevertheless, there is a lack of reliable measurements and appropriate scales. Quite often only a single-item approach is chosen or the applied items show a very strong tendency of agreement or disagreement on the measurement scale. Such items often overestimate the real share of consumers' sustainable food consumption. 
Therefore, the Witzenhausen_Food_Inventory_WFI aims to tackle this limitation by providing researchers with tested, valid, and reliable item inventories for the main dimensions of sustainable food consumption.
In the future, the WFI will cover the preference for organic, local and animal welfare-friendly produced foods. 
In the first step, we developed the WFI-OeL scale for measuring consumers' attitudes and preferences for organic food. the WFI-OeL is a tested and normally distributed scale that consists of five five-point Likert items. Below you find a list of publications where the WFI-OeL was applied.
